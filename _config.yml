  New manager of software engineering coming from a background in C++ and Linux development. After working in software engineering for a few years I decided to make the transistion to a technical manager from a software engineer. I wanted to make this transistion because I wanted to help drive the direction VMware Carbon Black was going, while challenging my fellow developers to achieve the most they can in their careers
